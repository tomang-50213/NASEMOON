<h1><em>In Collaboration with Simpson College</em></h1>
<p> This expedition to the moon is part of the study abroad 
program held at Simpson College starting the fall of 2020. 
This trip would act as a 4 credit course that fulfills a 
requirement for an aerospace engineer for a new major that 
will be implemented at Simpson College starting fall of 2020. </p>

<p>Why did we choose to collaborate with Simpson College? </p>

<p> According to Simpson's own website, they state, "Lots of colleges talk about making college affordable, 
but Simpson is actually doing something about it. 
Our commitment to affordability applies to everyone, regardless of income or financial need.
 Our generous scholarships and grants can open doors some may have thought were closed to them. 
Explore our financial aid options and see how we can help make a Simpson education a reality for you."

<p> Simpson is opening up a new major in Aerospace engineering and we saw this as a prime oppurtunity for us to 
collobarate with them. </p>

<p> Here are NASE we strive to make space affordable to passionate college students. </p>
