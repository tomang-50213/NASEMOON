    <h1><em>Aerospace Engineering Major</em></h1>

      <p> The aerospace engineer is primarily concerned with 
      the design, analysis, testing, and overall operation of
      vehicles that operate in air and space. The curriculum
      is designed to provide the student with an education 
      in the fundamental principles of aerodynamics, flight 
      dynamics, propulsion, structural mechanics, flight controls,
      design, testing, and space technologies. </p>

      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p> The mission of the aerospace engineering program is 
      to prepare the aerospace engineering student for a career
      with wide-ranging opportunities in research, development,
      design, production, sales, and management in the 
      aerospace industry and in the many related industries
      which are involved with the solution of multi-disciplinary,
      advanced technical problems. As well as have real-world
      experience in space with experienced Astronauts.</p>
